    "* The first 3 problems are \"practice\" and the time you take will not be counted. This is a good chance to see how the system works.\n",
    "* Puzzles are defined by `def puzzle(...)`. For each puzzle, you will try to find an input `x` which makes `puzzle(x)` return `True`.\n",
    "* Type `next_puzzle()` when you are ready to start the first problem or to advance to the next problem.\n",
    "* There is **no option to revisit a puzzle** and once you call `next_puzzle()` the clock starts ticking (you have up to 6 minutes per puzzle).\n",

    "* You have up to 6 minutes for each puzzle.\n",
    "* If you do not solve a problem in **6 minutes**, move to the next puzzle by typing `next_puzzle()`.\n",
