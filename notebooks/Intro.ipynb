    "See how your program solving abilities compare with the latest AI technologies by solving the puzzles below. \n",
    "\n",
    "**What is a Python Programming Puzzle?** Each puzzle is a Python function `sat`, and the goal is to find a *satisfying input*, meaning an  that makes `sat` return `True`. \n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def sat(s: str):\n",
    "    return \"Hello \" + s == \"Hello world\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution is `\"world\"` because `sat(\"world\")` evaluates to `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "What's makes puzzles so good for teaching AI to program? Previously, programming challenges were often written in English with some examples. But this requires teaching the computer English, which is hard and [unrelated](https://news.mit.edu/2020/brain-reading-computer-code-1215). \n",
    "Puzzles require reading *code* which is more relevant. Also, puzzles are *objective*---there is no arguing about whether a solution is correct. This is unlike the classic *what's the next number* problems where any answer could be justified.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next steps\n",
    "* If you have some extra time and want to try the timed version, try the full 30-puzzle [user study notebook](https://aka.ms/python_puzzles_study) where you have 6 minutes to solve each puzzle and there is no cheating.\n",
    "* **Try solving some of the puzzles below** to get a sense of what the deep learning systems did and did not solve. These systems include [GPT-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3) which \"picked up\" how to program from a huge text corpus that included source code. \n",
    "* **Read our [arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.05784)**. The main contribution is introducing a dataset of this new type of problem to teach and evaluate computers (and humans) programming. While AI is world champions at games like chess and go, human programmers still way outperform *program synthesis* systems.\n",
    "* **Visit our open-source GitHub repository** https://github.com/microsoft/PythonProgrammingPuzzles to explore the full dataset and **please contribute your own new puzzles**\n",

    "## Instructions to use the notebook below\n",
    "* Click on a cell and press the \"&#x25B6; Run\" button above to run the code.\n",
    "* For each puzzle, run the cell with the puzzle, then run your solution.\n",

    "The models include a few-shot GPT-3 solver and enumerative search techniques using random forests and deep models. The last is a puzzle version of the classic [quine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_(computing)) programming challenge of writing a program that prints itself out---this puzzle asks for a string whose evaluation is the same string itself. Moreover, the string has to have fewer than 6 characters. This puzzle was created during a fun [Microsoft Hackathon](https://github.com/microsoft/PythonProgrammingPuzzles#hackathon).\n",
    "\n",

    "This was solved by the GPT-3 model. The way the GPT-3 API works is that you give it a *prompt* and you ask it to complete the prompt. We gave it the following prompt:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def sat(quine: str):\n",

    "While it's too long and does not evaluate to itself, it clearly seems like the AI has some \"idea\" of what it is supposed to generate, but this type of quine is different than the standard one which needs to print something out. However, on the 37th completion, it outputted a valid solution. Is that cheating? No, the AI can make multiple tries just programmers often do. Did you make multiple attempts before solving some of the above problems? The objective advantage of puzzles is that the solver knows when it's done. If this were a programming competition where you only get one submission, you would evaluate your own submissions first of course to see if they are right. And the computer evaluates its own submissions really quickly!\n",
